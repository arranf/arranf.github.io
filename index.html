        <p>I'm Arran France and I'm a Software Engineering student at
            <a href="https://royalholloway.ac.uk" target="_blank">Royal Holloway University</a>.
        </p>

        <p> I build things in Java, C#, Python, Rust and JavaScript for mobile, web, and desktop. Some interesting projects of mine include a simple static client-side <a href="https://github.com/arranf/TravisEncryptWeb" target="_blank">encryption web
            service for Travis CI</a>, a JavaFX implementation of Conway's <a href="https://github.com/arranf/GameOfLife" target="_blank">Game of Life</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arranf/LowScore" target="_blank">LowScore</a> an Android app for IsThereAnyDeal.com, and a static Firebase
            backed Vue.js <a href="https://github.com/arranf/Vue-Notes">notes web app</a>.
        </p>

        <p>In the Summer of 2016, I took part in an undergraduate research project at Royal Holloway during which I produced an Angular.JS based web frontend and REST service for ExpoSE.JS, a tool for JavaScript symbolic execution. I also introduced a mechanism
            for pluggable serialization of ExpoSE's output.
        </p>

        <p>Following my undergraduate research project I did a five week internship at the <a href="http://sparkdevnetwork.org" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>Spark Development Network</a> working on v6 of Rock, including a system for notifications.
        </p>

        <p>In 2016 I was awarded The Ede & Ravenscroft First Year Science Faculty Prize for the best academic performance by a first year in the Faculty of Science, the Driver Prize for the best first year departmental performance, and a letter of commendation
            for my academic achievement.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I'm not studying I run <a href="https://bricksandmortarstudio.com"target="_blank">Bricks and Mortar Studio</a>, a development studio that produces plugins and provides custom development and consultancy for
            <a href="https://www.rockrms.com/" target="_blank">Rock RMS</a>. When I'm relaxing you can normally find me playing Arena Gods, writing, fishing, running, or playing board games with my friends..
