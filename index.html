        <p>I'm Arran France and I'm a Software Engineering student at
            <a href="https://royalholloway.ac.uk" target="_blank">Royal Holloway University</a>.
        </p>

        <p> I build things in Java, C#, Python, Rust and JavaScript. Some interesting web projects of mine include a simple static client-side <a href="https://github.com/arranf/TravisEncryptWeb" target="_blank">encryption web
            service for Travis CI</a> and a static Firebase backed Vue.js <a href="https://github.com/arranf/Vue-Notes">notes web app</a>.
        </p>


        <p>Alongside my studies I run <a href="https://bricksandmortarstudio.com"target="_blank">Bricks and Mortar Studio</a>, a development studio that provides custom development, data migration, and consultancy for
            <a href="https://www.rockrms.com/" target="_blank">Rock RMS</a>. Since launching in 2016 I have succesfully migrated four organisations and have worked with over a dozen clients. 
        </p>

        <p>In the Summer of 2016, I took part in an undergraduate research project at Royal Holloway during which I produced an Angular.JS based web frontend and REST service for <a href="https://github.com/ExpoSEJS/ExpoSE" target="_blank">ExpoSE.js</a>, a tool for JavaScript symbolic execution. I also introduced a mechanism
            for pluggable serialization of ExpoSE's output. I am continuing working on ExpoSE in 2017 to determine its limitations.
        </p>
            
        <p>In the Summer of 2016 I also did a five week internship at the <a href="http://sparkdevnetwork.org" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>Spark Development Network</a> working on v6 of Rock. During that time I shipped a number of features notably including a system for notifications. You can see the talk I gave at the RX 2016 conference <a href="https://www.rockrms.com/page/780?Item=308">here</a>.
        

        <p>In 2016 I was awarded The Ede & Ravenscroft First Year Science Faculty Prize for the best academic performance by a first year in the Faculty of Science, the Driver Prize for the best first year departmental performance, and a letter of commendation
            for my academic achievement. In 2017 I again received the the Driver Prize for the best second year departmental performance and was awarded a letter of commendation for my performance in the second year Team Project.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            When I'm not studying you can normally find me writing, fishing, running, or playing board games with my friends.
