                    <p>The past few months for me have been a time of transition. I have a new role at work, a new set of friends, and even a new home. On the whole I love change and the past few months have been incredibly exciting and inspiring for me but what I find most exciting of all is amidst the external changes is the way God has begun to work on me internally.</p>

<p>When I first became a Christian my life was transformed in a radical way. He gave me a new purpose, a new hope, and a new family and with that came a cascade of changes. Some changes were small, like the things I noticed as I walked to school, and other things were larger, like the way I related to people.</p>

<p>For months things changed in my life at a rapid rate but then things began to slow down and as they did I began to wonder whether someone I'd strayed from the path I was on and if I was beginning to get things wrong.</p>

<p>What I've learnt recently though is that there's still plenty of change happening it's just hidden underneath the surface.</p>
