# Small Group

Sometimes I feel the Church over-promises and under-delivers. I guess that’s part of feeling as if you’ve been sold a bill of goods. It promises love, joy, peace and purpose. It says give and you’ll receive. It says be a good person and good things will happen to you. Become a Christian and your life will change. Yeah, sorta… 

It reminds me of a network marketing organization (many of which, by the way, are launched within church setting). You have a bunch of people who aren’t good at sales out trying to sell with a little bit of information about their product. They over-hype and make promises they can’t possibly keep. It’s a second-class, circus-like sales organization that people don’t take seriously. “Oh. It’s a network marketing company? Great. You’re one of those people.”
 “Oh. You’re telling me I need church and God? Great. You’re one of those people.” 
 
After all, liberals have a valid argument about the “Christian Right,” don’t they? Divorce rates are similar. My own daughter is in spiritual limbo after growing up in the church. My in-laws are on the brink of divorce. My wife and I still have fights and have hard times “on the brink.” I’m estranged from my best friend and haven’t spoken with him in years. I’ve had business failures. I’ve felt crushed under the burden of debt. Hmmm. Yeah. I’m much better off than people who don’t go to church and those who don’t tithe!

  Why do so many Christians sell Jesus “pain-relievers”? Man, I must have missed that pill. He does rescue. He does save. But, I still feel pain. And, so did He. 
  
  So what is it? What is it that truly adds that value to life? For one, I have to remind myself “it’s not about here.” Our life on earth is temporary and our purpose is not an unwavering pursuit of happiness, wealth and health here…NO! We struggle, we work it out and we deal with it. We’re not immune to it…but our hope, prize and purpose is and will be with Christ. Shame on us for over-selling life here on earth.
  
  Can the church offer happiness? Healing? Financial relief? Longer life? Christian kids? Can it promise the fruits of the Spirit without being the Spirit? Many do.
  
  What is it that we can truly promise a seeker or a believer? I could go on, but I’ll stop there for now. I believe we can do better. We just need a better plan.
