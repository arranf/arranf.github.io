## Profile

A people-first software engineering manager who thrives wearing multiple hats and has a keen product focus.

## Experience

<WorkHistory-Block title="Tractable" subtitle="Team Lead (Equivalent EM 1)" years="May 2022-Present">

I am responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Estimating North America team (7 engineers) and the delivery of three strategic product lines in the North American region including our fastest growing product, reporting into the Director of Engineering. I work closely with my counterpart in product management (Director of Product) and research & AI development to define the team's strategy; and with stakeholders in customer solutions and customer success to plan delivery, align on roadmap priorities, and work with Tractable's partners.

11 engineers have directly reported to me during my tenure (4 currently), ranging from mid to staff level. I work with them to define their personal objectives, create opportunities for them to thrive within and outside the team, and give them feedback to support their growth. I also provide context from across the business, focus them towards our OKRs, support team ceremonies where necessary, and support them with sponsorship for cross-team engagements.

Within engineering, I work with senior management to define staffing needs, capacity planning, to align on the path to consolidating capabilities across the platform, and to support our hiring efforts.

Outside of engineering, I run the company-wide employee led ESAT initiative (with sponsorship from Head of People) to improve the workplace. I am also working with the people team as part of a small team redefining Tractable's company values.

I previously concurrently lead two platform oriented teams (8 engineers at senior and staff levels) with the mission to improve developer experience and deliver core services and capabilities for all product lines. In that role, I took on existing teams who needed to be realigned to be more focused on their users than their own preferences. I was able to reorient the teams toward their users, focus the teams on their users, and successfully lead an initiative to introduce a new auth platform into the company stack and support its adoption.

<WorkHistory-Block title="Tendable" subtitle="Tech Lead" years="June 2021-April 2022">

I was responsible for re-architecture of the platform's backend infrastructure from a monolith Ruby on Rails application to a scalable a microservice based architecture. Supporting that work I built an ETL framework to support analytics on large volumes of data, championed a move to a strongly typed RPC framework to support collaboration between back and mobile teams, wrote several reusable service templates and libraries. During my time, I also fixed a major security vulnerability and wrote tools to obtain metrics .

In addition to my individual contributions, I took a lead on improving the way our team worked. I developed and introduced a completely new hiring pipeline for backend, full stack, and frontend developers with bias controls; lead a migration from Bitbucket to GitHub; migrated our CI from a devops lead platform to GitHub Actions to empower developers, and introduced structured documentation processes for developers.

<WorkHistory-Block title="Tractable" subtitle="Developer" years="September 2020-June 2021">

I was responsible for building a growing feature set and scaling our architecture to meet a rapidly growing number of clients across multiple geographies.

During my time I took on independent initiatives including: adjusting our pipeline to support flows using both fully AI driven decisions and human in the loop decisions; rebuilding applications to migrate the team's services to Kubernetes from DC/OS; creating a framework for automated end-to-end testing of our pipeline in production; and making the product reproducible across environments.

I also helped improve the robustness of our codebase by kickstarting an initiative to introduce stronger types, extracting reused functionality into well tested libraries, and improving the resilience of our release process to prevent downtimes during deploys.

<WorkHistory-Block title="Limejump" subtitle="Developer" years="February 2019-September 2020">

I was responsible for the ongoing re-architecture and redesign of a critical customer facing application as part of a cross disciplinary UX focused team. On a day-to-day basis I worked on creating abstractions to trade-off simplicity, speed, and correctness whilst working on identifying what users really need.

During my time at Limejump I designed and implemented a solution that allows us to combine the existing legacy application with a new React implementation to allow us to incrementally deliver improvements to the user. I also architected and implemented a microservice approach to the backend to accommodate scale and cleanly divide responsibilities in a growing team.

Whilst at Limejump I drove change to several processes. I made significant contributions to our hiring and interview process, taking ownership of the technical screening phase of our process for full-stack and QA engineers. I also introduced guidance and led training around code reviews, introduced and led training on Kubernetes, and created and led an on-call system for our team. I took a role in mentoring developers and introduced a 'Friday Developer Talk' slot.

<WorkHistory-Block title="Bricks and Mortar Studio" subtitle="Owner/Director" years="2016-2020">
I ran my own consulting company working with non-profits to customise their processes and extend their software to support their needs. I performed data migration and wrote code for client-specific features. Examples include designing the API for a leading giving provider with $1m+ weekly revenue and producing a fit validating prototype for a pre-seed startup.

<WorkHistory-Block title="Spark Development Network" subtitle="Developer, Remote" years="June 2018-February 2019">

<!-- I built and designed features to specification for clients, incorporating them into the core OSS product when appropriate, or building them as a custom solution when not. Solutions were built to work at scale while maintaining high performance and reliability on both on-premise and cloud infrastructure. My primary focus was coordinating the development for a key strategic partner.

During my time I introduced developer best practices including code reviews and tools for enforcing code style and static analysis.

<WorkHistory-Block title="Royal Holloway, University of London" subtitle="Undergraduate Researcher" years="Summer 2016 / Summer 2017">

<!-- I produced a web interface (Rust/Angular 1) to queue jobs for a JavaScript symbolic execution engine and identified, wrote, and contributed a fix for a bug in Samsungâ€™s JavaScript analysis framework.

I also added features to the symbolic engine to help users analyse line coverage and to provide preliminary support for symbolic objects. Additionally, I performed a number of case studies on popular NPM libraries to identify areas of the engine that required improvement.

<!-- 
I worked on v6 of [Rock RMS](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/), a large (1000 KLOC+) C#/ASP.NET open source application for non-profits, including the first iteration of their notification and telemetry system. I also gave a talk at their annual conference on the benefits of open source software and the different roles that users and developers have within that ecosystem. -->

<!-- <WorkHistory-Block title="Jonathan's Movies" github-url="arranf/Jonathans-Movies-Client">

I built a Vue.js web application to make hosting movie nights among friends easier. The project leverages web sockets to display selections in real-time to all connected users. The server side also uses machine learning to produce movie recommendations for users using a cosine similarity matrix.

<WorkHistory-Block title="Heroes Companion" github-url="arranf/Heroes-Companion">

I built a Flutter application for Android and iOS to help users identify the optimal talent combinations for the game Heroes of the Storm.

The on-device application is supported by a data pipeline that translates in-game data via an AWS Lambda function. App content updates are provided by an Express/MongoDB backend which also scrapes statistics from the web.
