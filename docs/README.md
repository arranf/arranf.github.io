<profile-image />
I'm Arran France and I'm a people-first software engineering manager with a focus on building user-first products.

I work at Farewill where I lead the Legal Services and Funeral Plans teams. I previously worked at Tractable leading the Estimating product, and the Application Platform and the Engineering Platform teams.

### The Other Stuff

When I'm not working you can normally find me enjoying one of my hobbies. I enjoy writing, reading, making [YouTube videos on tabletop games](https://www.youtube.com/c/@arranfrance), watching the NFL (Go Cowboys!), playing board games, photography, and playing pen and paper RPGs with my friends.
