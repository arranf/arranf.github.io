I'm Arran France and I'm a people-first software engineering manager with a focus on building user-first products.

I lead the North American Estimating team at Tractable, who are responsible for delivering Tractable's fastest growing product offering. I previously led the Application Platform and the Engineering Platform teams providing product teams extendable reusable components and infrastructure tools to improve developer productivity.

### The Other Stuff

When I'm not working you can normally find me doing one of my dozen or so hobbies. I enjoy writing, reading, making [YouTube videos on tabletop games](https://www.youtube.com/c/@arranfrance), watching the NFL (Go Cowboys!), playing board games, photography, and playing pen and paper RPGs with my friends. I'm married to the beautiful [Catherine](https://catherinefrance.co.uk/).
