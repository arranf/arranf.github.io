<profile-image />
I'm Arran France and I'm a software engineer.

I run [Bricks and Mortar Studio](https://bricksandmortarstudio.com), a company that provides custom development, data migration, and consultancy for [Rock RMS](https://www.rockrms.com). Since launching in 2016 I have succesfully migrated a number of organisations and have worked with over a dozen clients, including the Spark Development Network.

In my spare time I build [Heroes Companion](https://github.com/arranf/Heroes-Companion), an iOS and Android application that helps Heroes of Storm players plan their optimal talents using real data. I also work on [Jonathan's Movies](https://github.com/arranf/jonathans-movies-client), a tool to help friends choose a movie together.

When I'm not working you can normally find me fishing, running, or playing board games with my friends. I'm married to the beautiful [Catherine](https://catherinefrance.co.uk/).
