I'm Arran France and I'm a Software Engineering graduate from [Royal Holloway University](https://royalholloway.ac.uk)

Alongside my studies I run [Bricks and Mortar Studio](https://bricksandmortarstudio.com), a company that provides custom development, data migration, and consultancy for [Rock RMS](https://www.rockrms.com). Since launching in 2016 I have succesfully migrated four organisations and have worked with over a dozen clients.

In the Summer of 2016, I took part in an undergraduate research project at Royal Holloway during which I produced an Angular.JS based web frontend and REST service for [ExpoSE.js](https://github.com/ExpoSEJS/ExpoSE), a tool for JavaScript symbolic execution. I also introduced a mechanism for pluggable serialization of ExpoSE's output. I am continuing working on ExpoSE in 2017 to determine its limitations.

In the Summer of 2016 I also did a five week internship at the [Spark Development Network](http://sparkdevnetwork.org) working on v6 of Rock. During that time I shipped a number of features notably including a system for notifications. You can see the talk I gave at the RX 2016 conference [here](https://www.rockrms.com/page/780?Item=308).

In 2016 I was awarded The Ede & Ravenscroft First Year Science Faculty Prize for the best academic performance by a first year in the Faculty of Science, the Driver Prize for the best first year departmental performance, and a letter of commendation for my academic achievement. In 2017 I again received the Driver Prize for the best second year departmental performance and was awarded a letter of commendation for my performance in the second year Team Project.

When I'm not studying you can normally find me writing, fishing, running, or playing board games with my friends.
