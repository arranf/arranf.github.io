## Architecture Notes

### CV

The CV is built using a [custom layout](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/advanced/cookbook/usage-of-client-config.html#layouts) and [Vue components](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#components).

### RPGs and Board Games

My RPG and Board Game pages use [vue-instantsearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/vue/).
